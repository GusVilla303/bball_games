Work In Progress -- Self-directed project

Live Project Link: 


B-Ball Games is an individual side project, which is currently in its early stages.  The app is able to retrieve location information for all Denver Recreation Centers (via http://data.denvergov.org) by running a `rake task` command through the terminal. 

To retrieve the most up-to-date Denver Rec Center locations information: 
```shell
rake locations:genertate
```
The app enables a user to authenticate by using Oauth (Twitter) to gain access to his/her dashboard.
